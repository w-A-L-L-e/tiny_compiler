# tiny_compiler proof of concept compiler generated with AI

So tried to use chat gpt to see if it can create some reasonable compiler code.
Conclusion it did a pretty good job on the lexer. The recursive descent parser did however (and still does)
contain some flaws. And with the compiling to fasm part it took many iterations to get something that kinda worked
but segfaulted when running. Then a few hours of debugging and actually doing some manual programming later we have a
minimal compiler from a script into fasm assembly.

## compiling the tiny compiler

```
make
cc    -c -o compiler.o compiler.c
cc    -c -o lexer.o lexer.c
cc    -c -o parser.o parser.c
cc    -c -o main.o main.c
cc   compiler.o lexer.o parser.o main.o   -o compiler
```

## run compiler, generate assembly and compile it with fasm

```
sudo apt get install fasm
make run
```

Make run shows the generated assembly output for the script (currently that is just hardcoded, but
future version should read the input script also from a file ofcourse):

Script code in main.c that we now want to compile:

```
    const char *code = "int x; x = 42; if (x) { return 22; }";
```

Compile it to assembly then run fasm to compile actual executable:

```
make run
```

And after this it uses fasm to compile and run it. Which will exit the program with an error
code 22 for demo purposes.

```
./compiler
Assembly written to output.asm
cat output.asm
format ELF executable 3

    ; Set up the stack frame
    push ebp         ; Save the old base pointer
    mov ebp, esp     ; Set the new base pointer
    mov eax, 42
    mov [ebp-4], eax
    mov eax, [ebp-4]
    cmp eax, 0
    je else_0
    mov eax, 22
    mov ebx, eax
    jmp program_end

    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

```

This is cool and all but its far from turing complete. And it seems whenever you try to add more complexity here it
just gets worse and worse even with the latest chat gpt. Whenever I tried to fix bugs or add new features (like else part of if / else statements)
it broke other parts and started heavily hallucinating solutions.

So it's cool that chat gpt can generate like 90% good code which saves a lot of typing and looking up trivial stuff with google.
But on the other hand I wrote a far more complete and
fully turing complete functional version of my own decades ago https://github.com/w-A-L-L-e/wsbasic.
Here I did have some background but the actual initial implemantation of wsbasic took me only 1 or 2 weekends. Ofcourse
I did have about 4 years experience writing parsers for my PhD back then.

I'm pretty sure I can now make the C version of such a recursive descent parser + compiler faster using chat gpt. However
It's also pretty clear someone without inital compiler knowledge will never get this working by just prompting and 'vibe coding' it.

Which might be good news I guesse. It's gonna be a while before real programmers are obsolete ;)

## Flaws and issues with current generated code

Just to make it verry clear. Yes using latest gpt on 16/6/2025 did save me a lot of typing
however the more I look at the generated code. There are a lot of hidden bugs
and memory leaks that most likely any vibe coder wouldn't notice until it totally crashes on them.

Current issues I just saw at first glance and was unsuccesful to fix using
some more chat gpt prompting:

- In parser.c multiple malloc's are made but nothing is freed (Big memory leak)

- https://github.com/w-A-L-L-e/tiny_compiler/blob/b7c1f9b54ad94fdaa5a954431eb0b2f27bdc5f5f/parser.c#L94
  : on this line we have the body of an if statgement. Issue 1: its just hardcoded
  to 100 nodes (meaning anything more than 100 statements will result in the compiler crashing with segfault).
  Again this malloc is also never freed

- If statements, the else part is totally not implemented however its hinted to be
  implemented in the generated compiler code later on.

- Expressions: only assignments to constants and variables are done.
  The interesting part to do actual arithmetic expressions is omitted entirely.

- The original recursive print_ast as was generated by chat gpt didn't work I had to manually
  tweak it to actually print the body of the program. (Again prompting more just would make
  it all worse and break more than it fixed). https://github.com/w-A-L-L-e/tiny_compiler/blob/b7c1f9b54ad94fdaa5a954431eb0b2f27bdc5f5f/parser.c#L146

- In the compiler we just get the bare minimum generated that just barely satisfies
  the hardcoded script with 1 assignment and 1 if without else and a return statement
  (and even then the generated version had a lot of bugs that needed manual fixing).
  However even now that most critical bugs are fixed, its not gonna work with real arithmetic expressions, while loops etc.
  Basically there's a whole lot more to do to just get something minimal turing complete working here
  and you'll need to know about compiler design to get it to ever work. Chat GPT in 2025
  is nowhere near up to this task which indeed is not trivial but again it was doable by myself
  in less than 4 days of coding without any of the current ai tools available.

## Conclusion for me in 2025:

AI code generation got better but it's still a decade at least
before we can truly replace proper developers entirely. It's nowhere near as good or dangerous
as the current AI hype and marketing on youtube is wanting to make it look.
Sure it can refactor and save you some typing. But it still lacks the deeper understanding
and reasoning that humans have when writing code.
